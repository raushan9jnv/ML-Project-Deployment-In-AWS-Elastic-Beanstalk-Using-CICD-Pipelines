# ML-Project-Deployment-In-AWS-Elastic-Beanstalk-Using-CICD-Pipelines
In this project, I'm Deploying ML application using CI CD Pipelines in AWS cloud. Service used is AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Tools and Services Used:
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Used to deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud.
- AWS CodePipeline: Used for automating the deployment process.
- GitHub: Integrated with CodePipeline for version control and automatic deployment.

## Impact
Streamlined the deployment process, reducing manual intervention and minimizing deployment errors. This approach enhanced the project's scalability and reliability, allowing for swift updates and ensuring a seamless user experience. The use of CI/CD pipelines increased development efficiency and facilitated collaboration among team members, ultimately leading to faster project delivery and improved overall productivity.
